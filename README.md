# edc_metadata

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/botswana-harvard/edc-metadata.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/botswana-harvard/edc-metadata)

`edc-meta-data` puts a meta data layer on top of your data collection models. The meta data can be used to display links to the data collection models on a dashboard (`edc_dashboard`) and be manipulated in ways that control how the meta data is displayed (`edc_metadata.rules`). A data manager can access metadata directly to quickly determine the completion status of required.

## Installation and Configuration

### To install:

    pip install git+https://github.com/botswana-harvard/edc-meta-data@develop#egg=edc-meta-data

    Note: `edc-meta-data` works together with `edc-visit-schedule`.
   
add to INSTALLED_APPS

    'edc_metadata.apps.AppConfig',

### To configure:

Meta data is collected in two models, `CrfMetaData` and `RequisitionMetaData`. 

Your application collects data on a schedule. Before declaring the `visit_schedule` let's prepare the models that will be used in the scheduled data collection. These models are your visit models, crf models and requisition models.

Your application also has one or more `Visit` models. Each visit model is declared with the `CreatesMetadataModelMixin`:

    class SubjectVisit(CreatesMetadataModelMixin, PreviousVisitMixin, VisitModelMixin,
                       RequiresConsentMixin, BaseUuidModel):
    
        appointment = models.OneToOneField(Appointment)
    
        class Meta(RequiresConsentMixin.Meta):
            app_label = 'example'

Your Crf models are declared with the `CrfModelMixin`:

    class CrfOne(CrfModelMixin, BaseUuidModel):
    
        subject_visit = models.ForeignKey(SubjectVisit)
    
        f1 = models.CharField(max_length=10, default='erik')
        
        class Meta:
            app_label = 'example'
    
Your requisition models are declared with the `RequisitionModelMixin`:

    class SubjectRequisition(RequisitionModelMixin, BaseUuidModel):
    
        subject_visit = models.ForeignKey(SubjectVisit)
    
        f1 = models.CharField(max_length=10, default='erik')

        class Meta:
            app_label = 'example'

## Introduction

Data collection follows a schedule where some collection tools or case report forms (CRFs) are required and others not. This module exposes a meta-data layer that can be used to manage and present CRFs scheduled for a visit or time point. 

See also edc-rule-groups.

### How metadata is created
CRF and Requisition meta data are created by the `meta_data_on_post_save` post-save signal for any model that uses the `VisitModelMixin` mixin.

### How metadata is updated
The same post-save signal updates existing meta data for other models that use either the `CrfMetaDataManager` or the `RequisitionMetaDatManager` from `edc_metadata.manager`.


### How metadata is manipulated in realtime

`edc_metadata.rules` provides classes that are used to write "rules" that manipulate the "entry status" of `crf` and `requisition` metadata. Rule are registered to `site_metadata_rules` in `metadata_rules.py`. Place this file in the root of your app. Each app can have one `metadata_rules.py`.

The EDC uses `edc_dashboard` to display a list of forms to be completed by the user per visit. The "list of forms" and the entry/save state of each form is persisted as metadata records generated by `edc_metadata`. Each model/form is represented by one metadata record for each visit. Read more in `edc_metadata`.

By default a user is required to complete all forms for a visit. That is, the metadata `entry_status` field is set to REQUIRED. The default `entry_status` can be globally changed in the `visit_schedule` or changed in realtime using `edc_metadata.rules`.

`edc_metadata.rules` offers classes with which you can build simple logic rules to change the metadata default `entry_status` value in realtime based on any persisted data in the database. You can operate on the current metadata instance or any in the subjects schedule.   

### `edc_metadata.rules`

#### autodiscover

AppConfig will `autodiscover` the rule files and print to the console whatever it finds:

     * checking for rule_groups ...
     * registered rule groups from application 'edc_example'

#### Inspect rule groups

Inspect rule groups from the site registry:

    >>> from edc_metadata.rules.site_metadata_rules import site_metadata_rules
        
    >>> for rule_groups in site_metadata_rules.registry.values():
    >>>    for rule_group in rule_groups:
    >>>        print(rule_group._meta.rules)
    
    (<edc_example.rule_groups.ExampleRuleGroup: crfs_male>, <edc_example.rule_groups.ExampleRuleGroup: crfs_female>)
    (<edc_example.rule_groups.ExampleRuleGroup2: bicycle>, <edc_example.rule_groups.ExampleRuleGroup2: car>)    
    
#### Usage

For a model that uses the `edc_metadata` mixin, each instance, be it the instance "to be" or the existing instance, has a corresponding metadata record. `edc_metadata.rules` act on those metadata records changing the `entry_status` to either "required" or "not required".

In `edc_metadata.rules` you declare a set of `Rules` contained in a `RuleGroup`. Each app has one 'rule_groups.py' that may have as many `RuleGroup` declarations as needed.

Let's start with an example from the perspective of the person entering subject data. On a dashboard there are 4 forms (models) to be completed. The "rule" is that if the subject is male, only the first two forms should be completed. If the subject is female, only the last two forms should be completed. So the metadata should show:

    Subject is Male:
    crf_one - REQUIRED, link to entry screen available
    crf_two - REQUIRED, link to entry screen available
    crf_three - NOT REQUIRED, link to entry screen not available
    crf_four - NOT REQUIRED, link to entry screen not available

    Subject is Female:
    crf_one - NOT REQUIRED
    crf_two - NOT REQUIRED
    crf_three - REQUIRED
    crf_four - REQUIRED

A `Rule` that changes the metadata if the subject is male would look like this:

    crfs_male = CrfRule(
        logic=Logic(
            predicate=P('gender', 'eq', 'MALE'),
            consequence=REQUIRED,
            alternative=NOT_REQUIRED),
        target_models=['crfone', 'crftwo'])

The rule above has a logic attribute that evaluates like an if/else statement. If 'gender' is equal to 'MALE' then set the metadata `entry_status` for `crf_one` and `crf_two` to REQUIRED, if not, set both to NOT_REQUIRED.

##### Rule Logic

The `Logic` class has a rule `predicate` that when evaluated is passed a few model instances each of which is checked for the `gender` attribute. If found, the predicate is evaluated to True or False.

The data that is made available for the rule `predicate` by default is:
* current visit model instance
* registered subject (see `edc_registration`)

For the rule above, `gender` would be automatically provided to the rule predicate during evaluation from registered subject.

##### Rule Groups

Rules are declared as attributes of a RuleGroup much like fields in a `django` model:

    @register()
    class ExampleRuleGroup(RuleGroup):
    
        crfs_male = CrfRule(
            logic=Logic(
                predicate=P('gender', 'eq', 'MALE'),
                consequence=REQUIRED,
                alternative=NOT_REQUIRED),
            target_models=['crfone', 'crftwo'])
    
        crfs_female = CrfRule(
            logic=Logic(
                predicate=P('gender', 'eq', FEMALE),
                consequence=REQUIRED,
                alternative=NOT_REQUIRED),
            target_models=['crfthree', 'crffour'])
    
        class Meta:
            app_label = 'edc_example'

Rule group class declarations are placed in file `rule_groups.py` in the root of your application. They are registered in the order in which they appear in the file. All rule groups are available from the `site_metadata_rules` global.

#### More on Rule Logic and Rule Predicates

##### Logic

The `consequence` and `alternative` except these values:
    
    from edc_metadata.constants import REQUIRED, NOT_REQUIRED
    from edc_metadata.rules.constants import DO_NOTHING

    * REQUIRED
    * NOT_REQUIRED
    * DO_NOTHING 

It is recommended to write the logic so that if the `predicate` evaluated to  `True`, the `consequence` is REQUIRED.

##### Rule Predicate values

In the examples above, the rule `predicate` can only access values that can be found on the subjects's current `visit` instance or `registered_subject` instance. If the value you need for the rule `predicate` is not on either of those instances, you can pass a `source_model`. With the `source_model` declared you would have these data available:

* current visit model instance
* registered subject (see `edc_registration`)
* source model instance for the current visit
* queryset of source model for the current subject_identifier (more on this one later)

Let's say the rules changes and instead of refering to `gender` (male/female) you wish to refer to the value field of `favorite_transport` on model `CrfTransport`. `favorite_transport` can be "car" or "bicycle". You want the first rule `predicate` to read as:

* "If `favorite_transport` is equal to `bicycle` then set the metadata `entry_status` for `crf_one` and `crf_two` to REQUIRED, if not, set both to NOT_REQUIRED" 

and the second to read as:

* "If `favorite_transport` is equal to `car` then set the metadata `entry_status` for `crf_three` and `crf_four` to REQUIRED, if not, set both to NOT_REQUIRED".

The field for car/bicycle, `favorite_transport` is on model `CrfTransport`. The RuleGroup might look like this: 

    @register()
    class ExampleRuleGroup(RuleGroup):
    
        bicycle = CrfRule(
            logic=Logic(
                predicate=P('favorite_transport', 'eq', 'bicycle'),
                consequence=REQUIRED,
                alternative=NOT_REQUIRED),
            target_models=['crfone', 'crftwo'])
    
        car = CrfRule(
            logic=Logic(
                predicate=P('favorite_transport', 'eq', car),
                consequence=REQUIRED,
                alternative=NOT_REQUIRED),
            target_models=['crfthree', 'crffour'])
    
        class Meta:
            app_label = 'edc_example'
            source_model = 'CrfTransport'

Note that `CrfTransport` is a `crf` model in the Edc. That is, it has a `foreign key` to the visit model. Internally the query will be constructed like this:
    
    # source model instance for the current visit 
    visit_attr = 'subject_visit'
    source_obj = CrfTansport.objects.get(**{visit_attr: visit}) 
    
    # queryset of source model for the current subject_identifier
    visit_attr = 'subject_visit'
    source_qs = CrfTansport.objects.filter(**{'{}__subject_identifier'.format(visit_attr): subject_identifier}) 
    
'''Important''': If the source model instance does not exist, the rules in the rule group will not run

##### More Complex Rule Predicates

There are two provided classes for the rule `predicate`, `P` and `PF`. With `P` you can make simple rule predicates like those used in the examples above. All standard opertors can be used. For example:

    predicate = P('gender', 'eq', 'MALE')
    predicate = P('referral_datetime', 'is not', None)
    predicate = P('age', '<=', 64)

If the logic needs to a bit more complicated, the `PF` class allows you to pass a `lambda` function directly:

    predicate = PF('age', func=lambda x: True if x >= 18 and x <= 64 else False)

    predicate = PF('age', 'gender', func=lambda x, y: True if x >= 18 and x <= 64 and y == MALE else False)
    
If the logic needs to be more complicated than is recommended for a simple lambda, you can just pass a function. When writing your function just remember that the rule `predicate` must always evaluate to True or False. 

    def my_func(visit, registered_subject, source_obj, source_qs):
        if source_obj.married and registered_subject.gender == FEMALE:
            return True
        return False

    predicate = my_func


#### Rule Group Order

RuleGroups are evaluated in the order they are registered and the rules within each rule group are evaluated in the order they are declared on the RuleGroup.


#### Testing

Since the order in which rules run matters, it is essential to test the rules together. See `tests` for some examples. When writing tests it may be helpful to know the following:

* the standard Edc model configuration assumes you have consent->enrollment->appointments->visit->crfs and requisitions. 
* rules can be instected after boot up in the global registry `site_metadata_rules`.
* all rules are run when the visit  is saved.

#### More examples

See `edc_example` for working RuleGroups and how models are configured with the `edc_metadata` mixins. The `tests` in `edc_metadata.rules` use the rule group and model classes in `edc_example`. 


#### Notes on Edc 

The standard Edc model configuration assumes you have a data entry flow like this:

    consent->enrollment->appointment->visit (1000)->crfs and requisitions
                         appointment->visit (2000)->crfs and requisitions
                         appointment->visit (3000)->crfs and requisitions
                         appointment->visit (4000)->crfs and requisitions
                         ...
(You should also see the other dependencies, `edc_consent`, `edc_visit_schedule`, `edc_appointment`, `edc_visit_tracking`, `edc_metadata`, etc.)

#### Signals

In the `signals` file: 

visit model `post_save`:

* Metadata is created for a particular visit and visit code, e.g. 1000, when the `visit` model is saved for a subject and visit code using the default `entry_status` configured in the `visit_schedule`.
* Immediately after creating metadata, all rules for the `app_label` are run in order. The `app_label` is the `app_label` of the visit model.

crf or requisition model `post_save`:

* the metadata instance for the crf/requisition is updated and then all rules are run.

crf or requisition model `post_delete`:

* the metadata instance for the crf/requisition is reset to the default `entry_status` and then all rules are run.
